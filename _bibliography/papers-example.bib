abstract = {As societal concerns on data privacy recently increase, we have witnessed data silos among multiple parties in various applications. Federated learning emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their raw data. Vertical federated learning, where each party owns different features of the same set of samples and only a single party has the label, is an important and challenging topic in federated learning. Communication costs among different parties have been a major hurdle for practical vertical learning systems. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient vertical federated learning algorithm named FedOnce, which requires only one-shot communication among parties. To improve model accuracy and provide privacy guarantee, FedOnce features unsupervised learning representations in the federated setting and privacy-preserving techniques based on moments accountant. The comprehensive experiments on 10 datasets demonstrate that FedOnce achieves close performance compared to state-of-the-art vertical federated learning algorithms with much lower communication costs. Meanwhile, our privacy-preserving technique significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under the same privacy budget.},

abstract = {This article presents and characterizes an Open Application Repository for Federated Learning (OARF), a benchmark suite for federated machine learning systems. Previously available benchmarks for federated learning (FL) have focused mainly on synthetic datasets and use a limited number of applications. OARF mimics more realistic application scenarios with publicly available datasets as different data silos in image, text, and structured data. Our characterization shows that the benchmark suite is diverse in data size, distribution, feature distribution, and learning task complexity. The extensive evaluations with reference implementations show the future research opportunities for important aspects of FL systems. We have developed reference implementations, and evaluated the important aspects of FL, including model accuracy, communication cost, throughput, and convergence time. Through these evaluations, we discovered some interesting findings such as FL can effectively increase end-to-end throughput. The code of OARF is publicly available on GitHub.1},

abstract = {As data privacy increasingly becomes a critical societal concern, federated learning has been a hot research topic in enabling the collaborative training of machine learning models among different organizations under the privacy restrictions. As researchers try to support more machine learning models with different privacy-preserving approaches, there is a requirement in developing systems and infrastructures to ease the development of various federated learning algorithms. Similar to deep learning systems such as PyTorch and TensorFlow that boost the development of deep learning, federated learning systems (FLSs) are equivalently important, and face challenges from various aspects such as effectiveness, efficiency, and privacy. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on federated learning systems. To understand the key design system components and guide future research, we introduce the definition of federated learning systems and analyze the system components. Moreover, we provide a thorough categorization for federated learning systems according to six different aspects, including data distribution, machine learning model, privacy mechanism, communication architecture, scale of federation and motivation of federation. The categorization can help the design of federated learning systems as shown in our case studies. By systematically summarizing the existing federated learning systems, we present the design factors, case studies, and future research opportunities.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
